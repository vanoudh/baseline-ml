      <p>Last updated: September 20, 2018</p>

      <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the baseline-ml.appspot.com website (the "Service") operated by Baseline ML ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
      <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
      <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service. </p>


      <h2>Accounts</h2>
      <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>
      <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>


      <h2>Data privacy</h2>
      <p>The data you provide remains your property.
        Your data will not be shared with third parties unless you explicitly consent to it.
        Baseline ML may access your data in order to improve the service.
        Baseline ML implements reasonable security measures in order to avoid data breaches, 
        but we recommend that you anonymise your data before submitting to our service.
        In general anonymisation will not affect the service utility and performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>
      <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Baseline ML.</p>
      <p>Baseline ML has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Baseline ML shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>
      <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.</p>


      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
      <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
      <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
      <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>
      <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>


      <h2>Limitation Of Liability</h2>
      <p>In no event shall Baseline ML, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
