    <title>Baseline ML - More</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2 id="why">Why Baseline ML ?</h2>
    <p>In data science as in innovation in general, it is good practice
      to work in short iterations, building prototypes and simple products quickly
      instead of spending months or years building the perfect product.
    </p>
    <p>Baseline ML helps you do that with machine learning models,
        providing the first models (baseline models) in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>I expect Baseline ML to be primarily used by data scientists but I
      hope it can also be a simple discovery tool for anyone trying to 
      leverage machine learning on their data.
    </p> 

    <h2 id="how">How does it work ?</h2>

    <p>Let's suppose you have data on the SF bay area house rental
      market and you want to know quickly what kind of baseline 
      performance you can expect when predicting prices.  
    </p>
    <p>First you need to <b>upload</b> your data as a CSV file,
      each line representing a data point (a house to rent),
      each column representing a feature (city, square footage, price...).
      The content of the file should look like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
Id,SquareFootage,City,MonthlyRent,YearlyRent
1,800,Palo Alto,3500,42000
2,1200,San Francisco,2900,34800
3,900,San Francisco,3000,36000
...
...
100,1500,San Mateo,3000,36000</pre>

    <p>For a full example file see here : <a href='house_prices_simple.csv'>Simplified Kaggle House Prices</a></p>

    <p>Then you have to choose the feature that you want to predict,
      i.e. the <b>target</b>. Baseline ML will present you 
      all the features that it found in the dataset and you will have to 
      click in the "target" column to select the target. Here you would  
      choose <i>MonthlyRent</i>. You may also click in the "ignored"
      column if some features should have no relation with the target or 
      on the contrary have too much relation with the target.
      Here you would ignore <i>Id</i> (no relation) and <i>YearlyRent</i> (too much relation).
      The other features remain in the default "predictor" column,
      you do not have to select them.
    </p>
    <p>Finally you simply press <b>run</b> and wait for the results. Baseline ML will
      take the first 80% of your data and tune a few baseline models:
      The model "zero" is barely a model, it uses the average or most 
      frequent value of the target as prediction, ignoring the other features.
      It is still useful as a baseline, especially when you are trying to
      predict a rare event.
      "linear", "tree", and "forest" are classic models with a little
      preprocessing and very little tuning, they should provide a fast and 
      decent baseline most of the time.
      After the tuning, the models are evaluated on the
      last 20% of the data. The performance on the last 20% is your 
      baseline performance and is displayed in the "Result" section. 
      The baseline performance is the kind of performance
      you can expect on this dataset, if it is satisfactory then it is great
      news, it should be easy to build a model at least as good. If it is
      disappointing try adding more meaningful features to your
      dataset, like the neighborhood for example. If it is extremely 
      good then make sure you ignored the features directly linked to
      your target.
      In any case, after you have done some exploration, talk to your 
      data science team !
    </p>
    <p>The performance will be shown in "mean absolute error", 
      this is simply the distance between the prediction and the true value,
      averaged over all the test data points. If the target is 
      in dollars, the performance will be in dollars.
    </p>
    <p>You can also try and predict the city based on the rent.
      In this case the performance will be shown in accuracy, this is
      simply the success rate of the prediction on the test data points.
      The accuracy is a percentage, between 0 and 100%.
    </p>

    <p>Note on data format : the features are usually separated by a comma, 
        but if you use
        something else like a semi-colon or a space it should work.
        If the file is compressed with a standard file extension,
        it should work as well.</p>
  
      <p>Note on data quality : of course a good data quality is always preferable,
        but it is especially true of the target, if your target is accurate with no missing values
        you do not have to worry too much about the other features : features
        with low quality will be ignored by the models.
      </p>
    
      <p>Note on data quantity : You should have at least 100 data points, 
          preferably 1000 or more, otherwise the results will have little
          credibility.
