    <h2 id="why">Why Baseline ML ?</h2>
    <p>In data science as in innovation in general, it is a very good practice
      to work in short iterations, building prototypes and simple products quickly
      instead of spending months or years building the perfect product.
    </p>
    <p>Baseline ML helps you do that with machine learning models,
        providing the first models (often called baseline models) in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>I expect Baseline ML to be primarily used by data scientist but I
      hope it can also be a simple discovery tool for anyone trying to 
      leverage machine learning on their data.
    </p> 

    <h2 id="how">How does it work ?</h2>

    <p>Let's suppose you have data on the SF bay area house rental
      market and you want to know quickly what kind of baseline 
      performance you can expect when predicting prices.  
    </p>
    <p>First you need to <b>upload</b> your data as a CSV file. 
      A CSV file is simply a table of your data, each column representing 
      a variable, each row representing a data point:</p>
    <p>
      <table>
          <tr><td>Id,SquareFootage,City,MonthlyRent,YearlyRent</td></tr>
          <tr><td>0,800,Palo Alto,3500,42000</td></tr>
          <tr><td>1,1200,San Francisco,2900,34800</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2,900,San Francisco,3000,36000</td></tr>
          <tr><td>...</td></tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>The variables can be separated by a comma or semi-colon or space. 
    The file can be compressed, Baseline ML will try to understand it.</p>

    <p>Then you have to choose the <b>target</b>. Baseline ML will present you
      the variables that it found in the dataset, and you will have to choose
      the one that you want to predict (the target). Here you may
      choose MonthlyRent as the target. You can also ignore 
      variables that should not be used for prediction, because it would
      make no sense or because they are directly linked to the target.
      Here you should ignore Id and YearlyRent.
    </p>
    <p>Finally you simply press <b>run</b> and wait for the results. Baseline ML will
      take the first 80% of your data to try a few baseline models.
      "nomodel" is barely a model, it predicts the average or most 
      frequent value of the target, ignoring the other variables.
      It is still useful as a baseline, especially when you are trying to
      predict a rare event.
      "linear", "tree", and "forest" are classic models with a little
      preprocessing and very little tuning, they should provide a fast and 
      decent baseline most of the time.
      After the tuning, the models are evaluated on the
      remaining 20% of the data. The performance on the last 20% is your 
      baseline 
      performance and is displayed. This is the kind of performance
      you can expect on this dataset, if it is satisfactory then it is great
      news, it should be easy to build a model at least as good. If it is
      disappointing try adding more meaningful variables to your
      dataset, like the neighborhood in our example. If it is extremelly 
      good then make sure you ignored the variables directly linked to
      your target, like the YearlyRent.
      In any case, after you have done some exploration, talk to your 
      data science team !
    </p>
    <p>The performance will be shown in "mean absolute error", 
      this is simply the error between the prediction and the reality,
      in absolute value and averaged over the test data points. If the target is 
      in dollars, the performance will be in dollars.
    </p>
    <p>You can also try and predict the city based on the rent.
      In this case the performance will be shown in accuracy, this is
      simply the success rate of the prediction on the test data points.
      The accuracy is a percentage, between 0 and 100%.
    </p>
    <p>In any case you should have at least 100 data points, 
      preferably 10 000 or more. Otherwise the results will have little
      credibility.</p>
